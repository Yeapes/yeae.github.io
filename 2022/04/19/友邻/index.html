<p>The <strong>dutiful</strong> daughter of a perfectionist mother, Ming, Mei is an <strong>overachiever</strong> who <strong>may well become</strong> a United Nations secretary-general, as her mom expects. Before taking office, though, she needs to release the <strong>wild animal</strong> of her inner adolescent, which she does in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>Something else colors Mei’s life as the film <strong>gathers force</strong>. She discovers to her horror, and our delight, that whenever her emotions <strong>get the best of her</strong> she turns into a huge red panda.</p>
<p>It’s a family thing, as it turns out, an <strong>affliction</strong> —or an inconvenience, to use her mother’s term—that goes back through generations of women to an ancient ancestor.</p>
<p>Mei’s panda <strong>pops out</strong> in response to any kind of excitement, including the anxiety, frustration, <strong>full-bore</strong> anger and irrepressible glee that get the best of many teens during most of their waking hours.</p>
<p>It’s a lovely comedic <strong>device</strong> —and Ms. Shi and her animation colleagues know how to make the most of it—but also a strong <strong>metaphor</strong> for breaking the traditional bonds of repression that will be familiar to daughters from families the world over.</p>
<p>How Long Should It Take to Grieve? Psychiatry Has Come Up With an Answer.</p>
<p>By Ellen Barry</p>
<p>After more than a decade of argument, psychiatry’s most powerful body in the United States added a new disorder this week to its diagnostic manual: prolonged grief.</p>
<p>The new diagnosis was designed to apply to a narrow slice of the population who are incapacitated, pining and ruminating a year after a loss, and unable to return to previous activities.</p>
<p>Dr. M. Katherine Shear, a psychiatry professor at Columbia University, said it was difficult to predict what treatments would emerge. She added, “I really am in favor of anything that helps people, honestly.”</p>
<p>Amy Cuzzola-Kern, 54, said Dr. Shear’s treatment helped her break out of a terrible loop.</p>
<p>Three years earlier, her brother had died suddenly in his sleep of a heart attack. Ms. Cuzzola-Kern found herself compulsively replaying the days and hours leading up to his death, wondering whether she should have noticed he was unwell or nudged him to go to the emergency room.</p>
<p>“I was in such a state of protest — this can’t be, this is a dream,” she said. “I felt like I was living in a suspended reality.”</p>
<p>She entered Dr. Shear’s 16-session program, called prolonged grief disorder therapy. In sessions with a therapist, she would narrate her recollection of the day that she learned her brother had died — a painful process, but one that gradually drained the horror out of the memory. By the end, she said, she had accepted the fact of his death.</p>
<p>The diagnosis, she said, mattered only because it was a gateway to the proper treatment.</p>
<p>“Am I ashamed or embarrassed? Do I feel pathological? No,” she said. “I needed professional help.”</p>
<h2 id="Netflix-Commercial-brake"><a href="#Netflix-Commercial-brake" class="headerlink" title="Netflix: Commercial brake"></a>Netflix: <strong>Commercial brake</strong></h2><p>The battered streamer tries to <strong>tempt</strong> back subscribers with ads.</p>
<p>In January Netflix warned investors that it expected to add only 2.5m subscribers in the quarter ahead, causing a <strong>sell-off</strong> that <strong>knocked</strong> nearly 30% <strong>off</strong> &#x2F;<em>We have knocked 10% off admission prices. its share price.</em> On April 19th the video-streamer admitted that the reality was worse: Netflix lost 200,000 customers in the period, its first <strong>net</strong> drop in more than a decade. The firm expects to lose another 2m between April and June. By April 20th it was worth 35% less than the day before—and 63% less than at the start of the year, <strong>wiping</strong> out nearly $170bn in market value and making it the worst-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<p><em>Subscribers in America <strong>drifted away</strong> after price rises that made Netflix the dearest big streaming service, at $15.49 a month.</em> Another 700,000 accounts were lost when Netflix <strong>pulled out</strong> <em>to get out of a bad situation or dangerous place, or to make someone or something do this</em> of Russia. Even in Latin America, where it had been growing fast, it <em>shed</em> members. And although it gained 1.1m new ones in Asia, that is fewer than in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Peaky economic conditions don’t <strong>help</strong>. <em>to make a situation better, easier, or less painful</em> Inflation is <strong>eating into</strong> households’ budgets; this week Kantar, a research firm, reported that overall streaming <strong>penetration</strong> in Britain fell in the latest quarter. Consumers also have more options. Hollywood is <strong>piling into</strong> streaming <strong>along with</strong> Silicon Valley, increasing competition for both customers and content.</p>
<p>Most worrying for Netflix is that the number of potential streaming customers may be lower than it thought. The firm has long said it is <strong>eyeing</strong> the world’s 1bn homes with broadband. <strong>It now acknowledges that factors such as slow <em>take-up</em> of smart TVs and expensive data are obstacles to <em>reaching</em> many of them.</strong> MoffettNathanson, a firm of analysts, <strong>puts</strong> the real potential streaming market <strong>at</strong> &#x2F;<em>to calculate or guess an amount, number, age etc, without being very exact</em> <strong>more like</strong> 400m homes. With 222m subscribers, plus 100m or so households using others’ passwords, Netflix is about 80% of the way there.</p>
<p>Reed Hastings, Netflix’s boss, promises a <strong>crackdown</strong> on password-sharing to make some free-riders <strong>cough up</strong>. To protect <strong>margins</strong>, Netflix will <strong>rein in</strong> content spending. Most dramatically, “over the next year or two” it will launch a cheaper <strong>tier</strong> with ads, to attract customers on lower budgets.It has long rejected advertising, which risks limiting creative freedom and <strong>cannibalising</strong> existing subscriptions. The ad industry’s giants, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta, are “tremendously powerful”, so “long term, there’s not easy money there”. Who says? Mr Hastings, two years ago.</p>
