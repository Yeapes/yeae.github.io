Before taking office, though, she needs to release the __wild animal__ of her inner adolescent, which she does in spectacular fashion.\n\nSomething else colors Mei’s life as the film __gathers force__. She discovers to her horror, and our delight, that whenever her emotions __get the best of her__ she turns into a huge red panda.\n\nIt's a family thing, as it turns out, an __affliction__ —or an inconvenience, to use her mother's term—that goes back through generations of women to an ancient ancestor.\n\nMei's panda __pops out__ in response to any kind of excitement, including the anxiety, frustration, __full-bore__ anger and irrepressible glee that get the best of many teens during most of their waking hours.\n\nIt's a lovely comedic __device__ —and Ms. Shi and her animation colleagues know how to make the most of it—but also a strong __metaphor__ for breaking the traditional bonds of repression that will be familiar to daughters from families the world over.\n\nHow Long Should It Take to Grieve? Psychiatry Has Come Up With an Answer.\n\nBy Ellen Barry\n\nAfter more than a decade of argument, psychiatry's most powerful body in the United States added a new disorder this week to its diagnostic manual: prolonged grief.\n\nThe new diagnosis was designed to apply to a narrow slice of the population who are incapacitated, pining and ruminating a year after a loss, and unable to return to previous activities.\n\nDr. M. Katherine Shear, a psychiatry professor at Columbia University, said it was difficult to predict what treatments would emerge. She added, \"I really am in favor of anything that helps people, honestly.\"\n\nAmy Cuzzola-Kern, 54, said Dr. Shear's treatment helped her break out of a terrible loop.\n\nThree years earlier, her brother had died suddenly in his sleep of a heart attack. Ms. Cuzzola-Kern found herself compulsively replaying the days and hours leading up to his death, wondering whether she should have noticed he was unwell or nudged him to go to the emergency room.\n\n\n\n\"I was in such a state of protest — this can't be, this is a dream,\" she said. \"I felt like I was living in a suspended reality.\"\n\nShe entered Dr. Shear's 16-session program, called prolonged grief disorder therapy. In sessions with a therapist, she would narrate her recollection of the day that she learned her brother had died — a painful process, but one that gradually drained the horror out of the memory. By the end, she said, she had accepted the fact of his death.\n\nThe diagnosis, she said, mattered only because it was a gateway to the proper treatment.\n\n\"Am I ashamed or embarrassed? Do I feel pathological? No,\" she said. \"I needed professional help.\"\n\n## Netflix: __Commercial brake__\nThe battered streamer tries to __tempt__ back subscribers with ads.\n\nIn January Netflix warned investors that it expected to add only 2.5m subscribers in the quarter ahead, causing a __sell-off__ that __knocked__ nearly 30% __off__ /_We have knocked 10% off admission prices. its share price._ On April 19th the video-streamer admitted that the reality was worse: Netflix lost 200,000 customers in the period, its first __net__ drop in more than a decade. The firm expects to lose another 2m between April and June. By April 20th it was worth 35% less than the day before—and 63% less than at the start of the year, __wiping__ out nearly $170bn in market value and making it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.\n\n_Subscribers in America __drifted away__ after price rises that made Netflix the dearest big streaming service, at $15.49 a month._ Another 700,000 accounts were lost when Netflix __pulled out__ _to get out of a bad situation or dangerous place, or to make someone or something do this_ of Russia. Even in Latin America, where it had been growing fast, it _shed_ members. And although it gained 1.1m new ones in Asia, that is fewer than in the same period last year.\n\nPeaky economic conditions don’t __help__. _to make a situation better, easier, or less painful_ Inflation is __eating into__ households’ budgets; this week Kantar, a research firm, reported that overall streaming __penetration__ in Britain fell in the latest quarter. Consumers also have more options. Hollywood is __piling into__ streaming __along with__ Silicon Valley, increasing competition for both customers and content.\n\nMost worrying for Netflix is that the number of potential streaming customers may be lower than it thought. The firm has long said it is __eyeing__ the world’s 1bn homes with broadband. __It now acknowledges that factors such as slow _take-up_ of smart TVs and expensive data are obstacles to _reaching_ many of them.__ MoffettNathanson, a firm of analysts, __puts__ the real potential streaming market __at__ /_to calculate or guess an amount, number, age etc, without being very exact_ __more like__ 400m homes. With 222m subscribers, plus 100m or so households using others’ passwords, Netflix is about 80% of the way there.\n\nReed Hastings, Netflix’s boss, promises a __crackdown__ on password-sharing to make some free-riders __cough up__. To protect __margins__, Netflix will __rein in__ content spending. Most dramatically, “over the next year or two” it will launch a cheaper __tier__ with ads, to attract customers on lower budgets.It has long rejected advertising, which risks limiting creative freedom and __cannibalising__ existing subscriptions. The ad industry’s giants, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta, are “tremendously powerful”, so “long term, there’s not easy money there”. Who says? Mr Hastings, two years ago.\n\n"},{"title":"Git","url":"/2022/04/15/Git/","content":"# Git入门\n\n## 文件管理\n\n### push\n- git init       //初始化.git\n- git add 文件名//本地推stage\n- git commit -m \"自定义\"  //stage推master\n\n### back\n- git log  \n- git log -- pretty=online\n- git reset --hard HEAD^  \n- git reset --hard HEAD^^    \n- git reset --hard HEAD~100\n- git status\n\n\n\n"},{"title":"单部六层","url":"/2022/04/11/单部六层/","content":"\n## 安装问题\n\n### 安装包\n- [失效联系_yeae](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1m9ySCF4B83yYQ081oI3ZGw)\n- raoraofeng@qq.com\n\n### 无限重启\n\n- 计算机\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager  \n- [破解软件_yeae](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=ER_IbaBd7GfhYhs_utG0eA)  \n- "},{"title":"我们仨","url":"/2022/04/11/我们仨/","content":"### @谨以此文记录我的大学青春\n\n\nby--齐天大圣&& Fourx && Winspider \n\n\n![](http://static.runoob.com/images/runoob-logo.png))](http://static.runoob.com/images/runoob-logo.png)\n\n![](D:\\Hexo\\source\\_posts\\我们仨\\../../themes/hexo-theme-Annie/source/img/微信图片_20220508150344.jpg)"},{"title":"穆佳","url":"/2022/04/10/穆佳/","content":"### 纵识乾坤大  \n### 不忘草木青"},{"title":"Hexo搭建","url":"/2022/04/10/Hexo搭建/","content":"\n\n### 关键词 \n- Node [官网链接](https://nodejs.org/en/) \n- Git  [官网链接](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\n- Hexo\n- Github  \n\n\n\n ### 1.安装Node Git并验证  \n- 验证：在命令行下分别执行 node-v  npm -v \n git-v  \n- 出现对应版本号即为成功  \n\n\n\n ### 2.更换淘宝镜像源\n - 命令：npm install -g cnpm –registry==https://registry.npm.taobao.org  \n - 验证：cnpm -v  \n \n \n ### 3.安装hexo\n  - 命令：cnpm install -g hexo-cli  \n  - 验证：hexo -v  \n\n\n ### 4.创建Github仓库  \n - user.github.io  \n - 配置SSH  \n        1.在C:\\Users\\用户名 文件夹下右键打开Git Bash Here输入命令：ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 邮件地址  \n        2.三次回车  \n        3.   .ssh文件内复制公钥内容添加至Github SSH and GPG keys  \n        4.验证:  ssh -T git@github.com  （不用改动）  \n        5. git config –global user.name \"用户名\"  \n            git config –global user.email \"注册邮箱\"  \n\n\n\n ### 5.使用 hexo 搭建博客\n - 创建文件夹放置博客内容，此文件夹内右键 Git Bash Here  \n - hexo初始化：hexo init  \n - 预览: hexo g && hexo s   \n\n\n ### 6.将hexo部署到GitHub\n - 博客目录下安装插件 :npm install hexo-deployer-git –save  \n - 编辑博客根目录下 _config.yml 文件, 在文件末尾添加如下内容：  \n deploy:  \n    type: git  \n    repo: https://github.com/user/user.github.io.git\n\tbranch: master  \n（user改为个人昵称；冒号之后存在空格）  \n- hexo d  \n- 网站访问 user.github.io\n\n### 参考视频\n- [Bibibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1je41147Ma?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)"}]
